  FlipperStroboMeterApp is a stroboscope application that allows users to measure the frequency of cyclical motion by emitting flashes of light at adjustable intervals.
  This tool is particularly useful for analyzing the speed of rotating objects or oscillating systems.

  Usage:
  1. Connect an LED to GND and Pin 4 (A4)
  2. Point the LED at the object you want to measure.
  3. Adjust the flash frequency using the controls.
  4. Observe the object's motion and fine-tune the frequency until the object appears to be stationary.
  5. Read the frequency value displayed on the screen.

  For further information, please visit the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/LeanderJDev/FlipperStroboMeterApp).

  Note:
  The frequency displayed by the application is the frequency of the flashes.
  If the object appears stationary at this frequency, the actual frequency could be a multiple of the displayed frequency.
  For example, if the object appears stationary at 10 Hz, the actual frequency of the object could be 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 30 Hz, etc.

  Disclaimer:
  When connecting an LED to the Flipper Zero, it is recommended to use a current-limiting resistor to prevent damage to the LED and the device.
  A typical value for the resistor is 220 ohms, but this may vary depending on the LED specifications.
