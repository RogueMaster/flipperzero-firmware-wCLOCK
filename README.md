## Build the program

Assuming the toolchain is already installed, copy **flipper_cigarette** directory to **applications_user**

Plug your **Flipper Zero** and build the flipper cigarette:
```
./fbt launch_app APPSRC=applications_user/flipper_cigarette
```

The program will automatically be launched after compilation

If you don't want to build this application, just simply copy **flipper_cigarette.fap** on your **Flipper Zero** 

## TODO

- add content for "about"
- include counter for cigarettes smoked
- cancer progress-bar
