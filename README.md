# drifter

Drifter is a boat game for the Flipper Zero

## Controls

Use left and right keys to affect the drift. The longer the keypress, the bigger the impact.

Press OK after a crash to start a new game, and back to exit.

## Credits

This is a "clone" of the excellent Drifter/ExRacer TI-89 game by Eric Burgess.
